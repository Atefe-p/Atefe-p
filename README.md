Hi! My name is Atefe Pooyan! 
I am an MD-MPH graduate currently working as a Radiology Post-doc at the University of Washington. 
Astound by the implications of AI in Healthcare, I am an advocate for the use of AI in Radiology to help improve patient outcomes and reduce costs. 
I'm working on projects to apply AI algorithms to medical imaging data to diagnose and treat diseases.
Always looking for ways to collaborate and share ideas.
